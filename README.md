# find_a_firefighter_I_class_near_you
Want to join the Volunteer Firefighters in Maryland? Find up and coming Firefighter I classes here.

## Geospatial Map of Classes
A map of all the class locations is available to help you visualize where they are.
You can view the map [here](https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/docs/firefighter_classes_map.html). **Note:** You'll need to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with the actual values after deployment.

### Regenerating the Map
If the `current_firefighter_I_classes.json` file is updated with new class information, the map can be regenerated by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python generate_map.py
```
This will update the `docs/firefighter_classes_map.html` file with the latest data.
